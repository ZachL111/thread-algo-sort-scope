# thread-algo-sort-scope

`thread-algo-sort-scope` explores algorithms in OCaml. The repository keeps the core rule set compact, then surrounds it with examples that show how the decisions move.

## Thread Algo Sort Scope Notes

The quickest review path is the verifier first, then the fixtures, then the operations note. That order makes it easy to see whether the code, data, and explanation still agree.

## Why This Exists

This project keeps the domain idea close to the tests. That makes it useful as a reference implementation, a small experiment, or a starting point for a more specialized tool.

## Implementation Notes

The interesting part is the boundary between accepted and reviewed scenarios. Extended examples sit near that boundary so future edits can show whether the model became more permissive or more cautious. The OCaml implementation keeps the data record and functions small enough to load directly in the test file.

## Example Scenarios

The examples are meant to be readable before they are exhaustive. They cover enough variation to show how latency and risk can pull a decision below the threshold.

## Feature Notes

- Uses fixture data to keep complexity tradeoffs changes visible in code review.
- Includes extended examples for golden cases, including `surge` and `degraded`.
- Documents boundary checks tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.
- Stores project constants and verification metadata in `metadata/project.json`.

## Local Setup

The only required setup is the local OCaml toolchain. After cloning, stay in the repo root so fixture paths resolve correctly.

## Tests

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Code Tour

- `src`: primary implementation
- `tests`: verification harness
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands

## Boundaries

The examples cover useful edges, not every edge. A larger version would add malformed-input tests, richer reports, and deeper domain parsers.

## Roadmap

- Add a loader for `examples/extended_cases.csv` and promote selected cases into the language test suite.
- Add a short report command that prints the score breakdown for a single scenario.
- Add malformed input fixtures so the failure path is as visible as the happy path.
- Add one more algorithms fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.

## Try It

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.
